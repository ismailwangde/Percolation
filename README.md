# Water Flow Simulation
This project simulates how many blocks need to be opened in an 𝑛 × 𝑛 grid for water to flow from the top row to the bottom row.


## Overview
### Objective: Find the minimum number of block openings to establish connectivity.


### Method:

Water starts from the middle of the top row.

Blocks are opened randomly, and water propagates through open paths.

The simulation stops when water reaches the bottom row.


## Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy

This project visualizes and quantifies water flow in a randomized grid.
